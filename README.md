# Web and UX Assignment

This site is for a tabletop game cafe digital ordering system.

## Getting Started

If you go from the index and click on the Menu button you'll be taken to the Menu page and then if you click on the Cloche icon a side menu will open and show what the order system would look like if it was fully operational.

Also if you go the Games page and click on the Settlers of Catan image you'll see a modal with all the information you need about the game.

## Important Information

The Feedback page doesn't exist also none of the advanced functionality is built in due to time constraints with the Assignment.
